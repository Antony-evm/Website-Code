<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> My undergraduate thesis focused on predicting company insolvency in the Greek Industrial World. This thesis was my first major effort in which I applied theory to real-world data. The approach was incredibly appealing, despite the fact that it ended up being focused on research and enhancing earlier discoveries. In this post, we will briefly summarise the motives for this study, our methods, and our findings. Without further ado, creditors, investors, lending institutions, and governments are all interested in anticipating business bankruptcy. This thesis examines the efficiency of several business prediction models based on numerous machine learning algorithms applied to a group of 145 financially challenged Greek enterprises between 2003 and 2004. These models evaluate the likelihood of bankruptcy using a range of accounting ratios and explanatory factors. Experiments have indicated that decision trees, neural networks, and the libraries H2O and AutoSklearn are useful in this sort of situation. Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, on the other hand, did not fare as well. Furthermore, boosting methods such as XG-Boost, CatBoost, and Gradient Boosting Machine were ineffective since the dataset was insufficient to justify their usage. The experimental results are consistent with previously reported findings and demonstrate that the proposed models produce promising results. </p>

<h2> What is Bankruptcy? </h2>

<p>Many various names have been used to describe bankruptcy throughout the years, including failure, financial trouble, and insolvency. The many words used to describe this phenomena might actually refer to different stages of the same activity, leading to misunderstanding about which technique is ideal. As a result, several researchers have attempted to provide a definition. It has been claimed in published papers, that a firm is declared bankrupt when any of the following events have occurred: "bankruptcy, bond default on an overdrawn account or non payment of a preferred stock dividend". As a result, the phenomena is inextricably linked to any financial issues that a firm may be experiencing. Inability to pay debts, a lack of liquidity, and a lack of assets all contribute to a corporation becoming bankrupt. Furthermore, it has been reasoned that for a company to declare bankruptcy, its assets should be lower than its liabilities. The negative net income pays down the company's debts and has a direct influence on its growth. The most common approach though to define a bankrupt company is judicial bankruptcy, meaning that the company has to declare insolvency with court order of the country it is operating in. </p>

<p>  The capacity to foresee bankruptcy as early as feasible is critical, not only from the perspective of management, but also from the perspective of investors and creditors. Lenders, investors, governments, and other stakeholders are keen to find an efficient approach to assess a company's financial capabilities so that they may make the best choice possible. Even a country's economy is assessed by its advancement in commerce, dealings with other nations, and the growth of industry and services within its own boundaries. As corporate failure is considered avoidable if the danger is detected soon enough for the appropriate measures to be taken, researchers have tried to develop machine learning and statistical models to predict financial risks and to capture the levels of sustainability of firms which may be unsuccessful. </p>

<p> In general, both endogenous and extrinsic variables influence a company's financial status. Endogenous factors are those that are associated with the company's management. More specifically, a company's policy is defined by the financial, natural, human, and technical resources it employs to achieve its objectives. Ineffective management, poor accounting information, and a mismatch between debt and assets are just a few of the factors that can contribute to financial distress. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, are those that the corporation cannot control. Sudden changes in the sector or the ebbing of the country's financial and political position are examples of circumstances that might lead to financial disaster. Other examples include legislative changes that have a direct influence on the company's policies or even market trends that make the product less popular. Most of the time, insolvency may be linked to a combination of these factors, which frequently succeed one another. </p>

<h2> Literature review </h2>

<p> The Altman's Z score is an essential model to examine because it is still utilised today. Altman presented a research in 1968 that examined the efficiency of multivariate analysis in predicting financial difficulty. There were 66 enterprises in his survey, half of which were insolvent and the rest were healthy. The 33 insolvent corporations declared bankruptcy between 1946 and 1965, with an average asset value of $6.4 million and a range of $0.7 million to $25.9 million. The healthy firms were picked at random based on the industry of the bankrupt ones, and their assets ranged from $1 million to $25 million. Altman selected 22 financial parameters that might help forecast financial collapse. Their selection was influenced by their presence in the literature and how effective they were thought to be at accomplishing this duty. He included several that were experimentally determined to be relevant in these 22 ratios. These ratios were then classified into five categories: liquidity, leverage, efficiency, profitability, and size. Five of the 22 ratios were chosen for the final model, which was dubbed the Z score. The formula is described below: <br>
Z = 0.012 * X1 + 0.014 * X2 + 0.033 * X3 + 0.006 * X4 + 0.999 * X5 <br>
where <br>
<ul>
	<li>X1: working capital/total assets</li>
	<li>X2: retained earnings/total assets</li>
	<li>X3: earnings before interest and tax/total assets</li>
	<li>X4: market value of equity/total liabilities</li>
	<li>X5: sales/total assets</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> It is worth noting that in most studies attempting to forecast company failure, the samples of bankrupt and healthy organisations are about equal. However, a paper from the 1980s concluded that if the comparison of bankrupt to healthy enterprises in a sample differs too much from the one in the present situation of the market, it might lead to incorrect conclusions and the model is not dependable enough. In terms of how the ratios in all of these studies are picked, there are many different perspectives on what the ideal technique is based on the literature. It is not uncommon for researchers to select the ratios utilised in their experiments using the three processes outlined below. To begin with, the first ratios are picked based on how frequently they have been used in the literature and how beneficial they were thought to be. Then, depending on the researchers' intuition, crucial ratios are added. Finally, the last list is made up of ratios that are unrelated to one another. Most research contain 8 to 10 ratios on average, and the greatest results were obtained by studies that included from 2 to 21 independent variables in total. </p>

<h2> Dataset Availability & Description </h2>

<p> There have been several sources utilised in the literature over the years. The Standard & Poor's Capital IQ Service, the Wind Financial Terminal Database, the CCER Economic and Financial Database, and the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund have all been used by academics. Another public data source for corporations operating in the United States is the 10-K Report, which is issued yearly by publicly traded companies and provides information about their financial performance as mandated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive salaries, and financial statements are among the topics included in the report. The SEC mandates this report to keep investors informed of a company's financial situation and to provide them with sufficient information before they buy or sell stock in the corporation or invest in the firm's corporate bonds. There is also the Polish Dataset, which predicts the insolvency of Polish enterprises. The information was gathered from the Developing Markets Information Service, a database that contains information on emerging markets throughout the world. Bankrupt firms were studied from 2000 to 2012, whereas still operational enterprises were studied from 2007 to 2013. Finally, as is customary practise, researchers can obtain information from stock exchanges. Below is a complete summary of the advantages and disadvantages of various resources. </p>

<p> Despite the benefits that some of these sites bring, none of them are concerned with the Greek Industrial World. To that purpose, after experimenting with numerous methods, we obtained our dataset from the ICAP database. It comprises 49 insolvent companies and 96 healthy enterprises for a total of 145 entities. The years of bankruptcy in the sample are 2003 and 2004, and we have up to three years of data previous to insolvency. This is not the first study to use this dataset, thus we anticipate improving on previously studied methodologies. We have separated our data into three independent datasets, each of which has one additional year's worth of data, up to the last one, which contains all of the information accessible to us. The ratios used in this study are listed in the table below, categorised into their respective groups.  </p>

<p><img src = '/static/categories_pics/projects/predicting_bankruptcy/2. Ratios.png' width='40%'/></p>

<p>The size of the firm is calculated using the logarithm of the total assets divided by the GDP Price Index. The logarithm of total assets is used as a proxy measure of the company's size. The GDP price index measures inflation in the prices of goods and services manufactured in the country. The GDP price index takes into account the costs of products and services exported to other nations. The key advantage of monitoring this indicator is that it can demonstrate the economy's development or lack thereof over time. As a result, this ratio is tied to both the firm's growth and the economy of the nation in which the company works. </p>

<p>Analysts utilise efficiency ratios, also known as activity ratios, to assess a company's short-term or present performance. All of these ratios employ statistics from a company's current assets or current liabilities to quantify commercial activities. An efficiency ratio assesses a company's capacity to create income from its assets. An efficiency ratio can calculate receivables turnover, liability payback, equity amount and utilisation, and general inventory and machinery use. </p>

<p> Profitability ratios are a type of financial indicator that is used to evaluate a company's capacity to create earnings compared to its revenue, operational costs, balance sheet assets, and shareholders' equity over time, utilising data from a single point in time. A higher number comparing to a competitor's ratio or the same ratio from a prior period shows that the firm is performing well for most profitability ratios. When comparing a subject firm to other, comparable companies, the company's own history, or typical ratios for the company's industry as a whole, ratios are most instructive and beneficial. </p>
<p> The capacity to turn assets into cash rapidly and cheaply is referred to as liquidity. When used in comparison, liquidity ratios are most beneficial. This examination might be internal or external. Liquidity ratios are a type of financial indicator that assesses a debtor's capacity to repay existing debt commitments without raising external cash. Liquidity ratios use variables such as the current ratio, quick ratio, and operational cash flow ratio to assess a company's capacity to satisfy debt obligations and margin of safety. </p>
<p> A combination of the following ratios should offer an overall picture of a company's financial health. As previously stated, most effective studies use a mix of 2 to 21 ratios. As a result, our dataset, which is made up of 13 ratios that cover the bulk of financial ratio categories, has a good chance of succeeding in this assignment. </p>

<h2> Algorithms, Implementation and Results </h2>

<p> A variety of algorithms were implemented throughout study, as indicated in earlier chapters. Many of the most common machine learning approaches have been employed to tackle the challenge of forecasting company bankruptcy in the algorithms that were built. Logistic regression, naive bayes classifiers, decision trees, neural networks, and different boosting algorithms such as extreme gradient boosting, cat boost, and the vanilla gradient boosting classifier are among them. Furthermore, the libraries H2O and Autosklearn were examined in order to employ automated machine learning technology to perhaps develop better models, although these libraries have not been extensively used in the literature due to their newness in the area. To discover the best models during the study, the library GridSearchCV and other dynamic methods of implementation were extensively used to ensure that the parameters of each algorithm were tweaked in the best way possible, while also avoiding overfitting. AUC, a measure suited for skewed datasets, was chosen as the success statistic. Furthermore, AUC indicates how random our predictions are, with 0.5 indicating full unpredictability, 1 indicating perfect separation of the classes in our forecasts, and 0 indicating that our predictions are the exact opposite of what they should be. We compare our findings to those of earlier researchers because the dataset was gathered by them and comparable procedures were utilised. This comparison is shown in the table below, and the 'Patra' prefix reflects the findings of the aforementioned research. </p>

<p><img src = '/static/categories_pics/projects/predicting_bankruptcy/3. Results.png' width='40%'/></p>

<p> To begin, it is vital to highlight that we outperformed prior findings in each of these datasets. Logistic regression and naive bayes underperformed significantly, with the models being random or very near to it. Furthermore, despite being touted as algorithms with very good results, extreme gradient boosting and cat boost did quite poorly as well, most likely because the dataset was too small for these algorithms to perform the expected way. To be more specific, boosting techniques have been shown to perform better with datasets of above 10000 rows, which we are nowhere close in our instance. Out of all the algorithms, Autosklearn, Neural Networks, and Cart Decision Trees had the greatest and most consistent overall performance. Furthermore, these algorithms outperformed prior results by 8.6%, 27.1%, and 11.7%, respectively. What is intriguing is the range of algorithms that have produced the best outcomes for each dataset. In specifically, in the "1 years prior" dataset, AutoSklearn produces the greatest result at 0.721, while the lowest is 0.65. (out of the reasonable performances). The findings in the "2 years prior" dataset vary significantly, ranging from 0.621 to 0.797, whereas in the "last year" dataset, we range from 0.647 to 0.818. It is worth noting that the algorithms that have done well are those that are usually regarded as good when dealing with unstructured data. What we can conclude from this is that our dataset may contain some randomness rather than linearity, which is to be expected given the nature of the issue we are attempting to address. In terms of the models that produced these findings, while I cannot provide the exact dataset utilised here, I will discuss some details in the code implementation section of this project.  </p>

<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p> During our investigation, we discovered that decision trees had the highest overall performance, correctly forecasting company insolvency up to three years before it occurred. What's intriguing is that this accomplishment does not convert into an ease of predicting financial difficulty two years before bankruptcy, although the algorithms perform better again in the final year of worry. However, the earlier the warning signs are highlighted, the better for the firm. Being informed just one year before filing for bankruptcy, it may be evident for the management to have financial difficulties. However, planning three years ahead of time can assist a lot of organisations reverse course and enter a phase of consolidation. The years that follow might play a more consultative role for a firm to determine if their performance has improved. To take things a step further, we believe it is important to assess not just the performance of prediction tools (effectiveness), but also their economic and organisational sustainability (efficiency).</p>

<p> The efficiency study offers a fundamental understanding of the diagnostic equipment' potential applications inside a company/profession. Indeed, models that are very successful yet prohibitively expensive and burdensome for the user's organisational apparatus would remain unusable. As a result, the effectiveness and efficiency metrics must be analysed from a systematic standpoint. Naturally, the assessment of these criteria is subjective because it is dependent on the individual features and demands of the user. In terms of the latter, we have shown that instruments developed using more advanced approaches (neural networks and automated machine learning) are difficult to maintain by small-medium Greek users. The intricacy that comes with the use of such instruments is very taxing on the user's organisation, as well as having significant direct and indirect expenses. What emerges - at least in terms of a comprehensive application - is a form of trade-off between what has been investigated in the literature on prediction models and what is necessary in a day-to-day operation.
Even while academics have evolved in recent years toward the development of instruments using increasingly complex methodologies, what operators want is the availability of trustworthy models that are also sustainable. Models can only be utilised profitably on the field if these prerequisites are met.What is encouraging is that Decision Trees constitute a comprehensive and computationally effective method of predicting bankruptcy. Furthermore, this approach has shown extremely good outcomes over a three-year period, making it appropriate for this type of application. </p>

<p> Finally, we wish to emphasise that these findings are not transferrable to the field in their current form. To grasp this topic further, we must first comprehend two components of the whole study that has been undertaken thus far. For starters, models in the literature that employ datasets from other sectors, such as the US, cannot be applied in the Greek industry since the Greek economy is distinct from the US economy in more ways than one. Following the same principle, historical data cannot always be an accurate reflection of a current company's financial health. It is commonly known that the Greek economy has suffered in recent years. As a result, the financial ratio ranges that define a healthy firm in 2003-2004 will be radically different from those that represent a healthy company that has weathered a couple of crises. A more in-depth examination of each industry of operation is another strategy that may be adopted for better outcomes, as each sector has its unique behaviour. However, due to a lack of readily available data, this is a particularly difficult undertaking.
</p>

<h2> Implementation </h2>

<p> In this section, we will use the Iris Dataset to build all of the aforementioned techniques. Our purpose in this section is to demonstrate a simple implementation rather than to delve further into each technique; hence, the process outlined here should not be employed with appropriate datasets. We will take deep dives into other projects to demonstrate how to follow good methodology, construct pipelines, and find the best solution. Finally, before we begin, autosklearn is not presently accessible on Windows. </p>

<p> First, we load all of the necessary libraries. </p>
