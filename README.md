# Intro
Welcome to my portfolio website built with Flask! This website is designed to help people improve their Python skills. Using Flask, I've created a platform where users can access tutorials, code examples, and resources to enhance their Python & data science skills.
The website is still in its infancy and I've spent a lot of time developing it from scratch as this is not my primary domain knowledge, but I wanted to learn how to do it.

To run the website locally, follow the instructions in the documentation. You can also contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or reporting issues.

If you enjoy the content provided (and I will keep updating this regularly), don't hesitate to drop a star/comment or pay my [website](aevmorfop.co.uk) a visit!


# Documentation

Clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the local repository via command prompt and run
<ul> <li> pip install -r requirements.txt </li>
	<li> python application.py</li>
</ul>

The only thing that needs to change is in the `attrs.py` file, where you need to post your own email and app generated password. Let me know if you need help with this.

# Features

I've created a few templates to start uploading my projects.

<ul>
	<li> <a href = "http://aevmorfop.co.uk/topics/projects" target="_blank" class='contact_url'>Projects</a></li>
	<li> <a href = "http://aevmorfop.co.uk/topics/guides" target="_blank" class='contact_url'>Guides</a></li>
	<li> <a href = "http://aevmorfop.co.uk/topics/data_science" target="_blank" class='contact_url'>Data Science</a></li>
</ul>

# Contributions

Any and all feedback is welcome. But most welcome are the ones that will improve the website experience. It is by no means perfect and I would appreciate any help/feedback on my html/css/js structure and functionalities. Or even on how to make the flask code more professional.
