# website
I've built the following website with the intention to host my portfolio & to write about things that excite me around Data Science, Programming and any other concept.
In this repo, I'm including the details on how I've built the website as it has been an educational journey for me.
Pay a visit at aevmorfop.co.uk and let me know what you think.
